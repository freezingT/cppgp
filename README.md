# CppGP - A versatile Gaussian Process implementation in C++

CppGP is a Gaussian process library implemented in C++.

The framework is based on the Matlab toolbox [GPmat](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPmat) by Neil Lawrence and others. However, it aims to be not a simple port to C++ but to implement new features like the ability to use derivatives as input data.
